/* We want to suppress issues from Sonar analyzers that are added via NuGet.
 * If the analyzer in the NuGet is of a different version from the one in the VSIX then just
 * setting the static property on the version referenced by the VSIX won't work (both analyzer
 * assemblies will be loaded in memory, each with its own static class + property).
 * We need to set the static property for each Sonar analyzer assembly that is loaded.
 *
 * Version-compatibility: the NuGet package and VSIX might reference different versions of Roslyn etc,git branch
 * but we need to be able to assign a delegate from the VSIX to the NuGet static property.
 * If the NuGet package is using a higher version of Roslyn then the analyzer won't work anyway.
 * If is is using a lower version of Roslyn then the binding redirect in VS should make the assignment works.
